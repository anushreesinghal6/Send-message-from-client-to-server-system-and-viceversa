In this example, the server listens on IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and port 12345. The client connects to the same IP and port. You can modify the IP and port as needed.

To run the chat application:

Start the server by running python server.py in one terminal.
Start the client by running python client.py in another terminal.
You can then send messages back and forth between the client and server.
